# BallisticNG-RNGSHIP-Texture-Generator
WARNING: HIGHLY UNSTABLE. NOT YET SUITABLE FOR USE OUTSIDE DEVELOPMENT.
CURRENTLY REQUIRES SDL2 TO USE THE PREVIEW LOOP IN MAIN_TEST.C!

Generates the texture to use with the output of the random ship generator.

Requires quite a bit of cleaning and documenting, but I'll get around doing that when I have it running properly.
